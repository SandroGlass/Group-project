        The number of nuclear weapons in the world increased this year for the first time in decades,
        as China tripled
        its nuclear arsenal to 600.

    <h2>Global Nuclear Stockpiles Rising for First Time Since 1986
    </h2>

    <div id="linechart1">
    </div>
    <h2> Countries are discreetly increasing their stockpiles
    </h2>
    <div id="linechart2">
    </div>
    <p>This increase is one of the reasons why the scientists moved the Doomsday Clock, which warns about humanity's
        danger of self-destruction, closer to midnight than ever before. </p>
    <p>The UK had already increased the limit on how many nuclear weapons it holds from 225 to 260.</p>
    <p>Britain is now prioritizing expansion "without much transparency" about what weapons remain operational versus
        those in storage, Dave Cullen of BASIC, a London-based think tank, says.</p>
    <p>Rob Green, lead nuclear regulator at the Environment Agency, doesn’t expect the UK numbers to drop any time soon.

    </p>
    <p> “The only time that would ever change is if UK government policy changed, and they said, ‘Well, you know what?
        We don’t need a nuclear weapon anymore.’” he says.
    </p>
    <p>Although Russia and the US are reducing their vast arsenals, countries are not dismantling as many weapons as
        they used to.</p>
    <p>As some countries increase their stockpiles, or slow down the rate at which they decommission, embattled Ukraine
        wants to take back the nuclear weapons it gave up as the Cold War was ending.</p>
    <h2> Ukraine in 1994: Third-Largest Nuclear Arsenal and Critical Military Facilities </h2>
    <div id="ukraine">
        <div id="map-container" class="map-container"></div>
    </div>
    <p>Ukraine inherited the world’s third-biggest nuclear arsenal in 1991 before giving them up as part of Budapest
        Memorandum, a security assurances document, signed by the US, UK and Russia. </p>
    <p>A 2024 study found that almost three quarters of Ukrainians want them back.
    </p>
    <p>Dr Mariana Budjeryn, is Senior Research Associate at the Harvard Kennedy School Belfer Centre, and author of a
        book about Ukraine’s nuclear disarmament, doesn’t believe the arsenal would have prevented Russia’s invasion but
        believes Ukraine could have protected itself better.</p>

    <p>"It was too binary—either give up nukes or not, without considering options in between," Budjeryn argues.</p>

    <p>"I'm pretty sure the world would have paid closer attention to Ukraine's borders for fear of its nuclear
        program," she concludes.</p>

    <p>While many in Ukraine regret their loss, 8,000 kilometres to the East, the survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
        bombing voice against the usage of nuclear weapons.</p>

    <p>“We have to keep telling and recording our stories to let people know what happened” insists Satoshi Tanaka, a
        member of the Nobel Peace Prize winning survivor group Nihon Hidankyo.</p>

    <p>The 81-year-old survivor of Hiroshima is concerned that amid the rise of nuclear risk, people who can tell
        stories of what happens when the weapons are used are dwindling.</p>
    <p>There used to be at least over 370,000 in 1980. Now, there are only just over 100,000. “It is said that in ten
        years, there will be no survivors left”, says Satoshi.</p>

    <div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; width: 200px;"> Satoshi Tanaka entered the destroyed city of
        Hiroshima the day after the bombing at 1 year-old. His family and relatives suffered injury and illness due to
        radiation, and he had lost eleven of them, with one missing. When he was a university student, he faced a
        discrimination against him when a flatmate asked, “are you sure the atomic bomb disease is not infectious?”. And
        since in his fifties, he suffered from six cancers. He, along with many survivors today, are afraid of cancers
        and illnesses that might strike. And with the rising nuclear threat, Satoshi says “they are not old stories. It
        is continuing today”.</div>

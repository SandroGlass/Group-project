        <p>Rob Green, the nuclear regulator at the Environment Agency, doesn’t expect the UK stockpile numbers to drop
            any
            time
            soon.
        <p> “The only time that would ever change is if UK government policy changed, and they said, ‘Well, you know
            what?
            We don’t need a nuclear weapon anymore.’” he says.
        </p>
        <p>Countries are not dismantling as many
            weapons as
            they used to, although Russia and the US are reducing their vast arsenals. </p>
        <p>The UK is now prioritizing expansion "without much transparency" about what weapons remain operational
            versus
            those in storage, Dave Cullen of BASIC, a London-based think tank, says.</p>

        <p>And as some countries increase their stockpiles, or slow down the rate at which they decommission, embattled
            Ukraine
            wants to take back the nuclear weapons it gave up when the Cold War was ending.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Ukraine had the world’s third-biggest nuclear arsenal in 1991 before giving them up as part of
        an agreement by the US, UK and Russia. </p>
    <p>Now, almost three quarters of Ukrainians want them back according to a 2024 study.

            <h3>The promise of the Budapest Memorandum</h3>
            <p style="width: auto; line-height: 1.4;"> When Ukraine signed
                the
                1994 Budapest Memorandum, it surrendered approximately 1,900 strategic nuclear warheads in exchange for
                security
                assurances from Russia, the US, and the UK.
                When Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and later launched a full-scale invasion,
                Ukraine found itself with no nuclear deterrant against an aggressor that had pledged to respect its
                borders. In 2022,
                President Zelensky bitterly noted that allies had provided only a small amount of diesel fuel, "probably
                so
                that we can burn the Budapest Memorandum."</p>

                due
                to
                radiation, and he had lost eleven of them, and one missing. When he was a university student, he
                faced a
                discrimination against him when a flatmate asked, “Are you sure the atomic bomb disease is not
                infectious?”.
                And
                since in his fifties, he suffered from six cancers. He, along with many survivors today, are afraid
                of
                cancers
                and illnesses that might strike. And with the rising nuclear threat, Satoshi says “they are not old
                stories.
                It
                is continuing today”.</p>

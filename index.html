        <p>Rob Green, the nuclear regulator at the Environment Agency, doesn’t expect the UK stockpile numbers to
            drop
            any
            time
            soon.
        <p> “The only time that would ever change is if UK government policy changed, and they said, ‘Well, you know
            what?
            We don’t need a nuclear weapon anymore.’” he says.
        </p>
        <p>Countries are not dismantling as many
            weapons as
            they used to, although Russia and the US are still reducing their vast arsenals. </p>
        <p>The UK is now prioritizing expansion "without much transparency" about what weapons remain operational
            versus
            those in storage, says Dave Cullen of BASIC, a nuclear disarmament think tank in London.</p>

        <p>And as some countries increase their stockpiles, or slow down the rate at which they decommission, embattled
            Ukraine
            wants to take back the nuclear weapons it gave up when the Cold War was ending.</p>
        <p>Ukraine had the world’s third-biggest nuclear arsenal in 1991 before giving up its weapons as part of
            an agreement by the US, UK and Russia. </p>
        <p>Now, almost three quarters of Ukrainians want them back according to a 2024 study.

        <p>"It was too binary—either give up nukes or not, without considering options in between," Budjeryn argues.

            <h3>The promises of the Budapest Memorandum</h3>
            <p style="width: auto; line-height: 1.4;"> When Ukraine signed
                the
                1994 Budapest Memorandum, it surrendered approximately 1,900 strategic nuclear warheads in exchange for
                security
                assurances from Russia, the US, and the UK.
                When Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and later launched a full-scale invasion,
                Ukraine found itself with no nuclear deterrent against an aggressor that had pledged to respect its
                borders. In 2022,
                President Zelensky bitterly noted that allies had provided only a small amount of diesel fuel, "probably
                so
                that we can burn the Budapest Memorandum."</p>

            <p style="width: auto; line-height: 1.4;"> Satoshi Tanaka was one year old when his mother brought him into
                the destroyed city of Hiroshima the day after the bombing. She took him with her to look for her
                parents and relatives who were living about 900m from the epicentre. In the immediate aftermath and in the years that followed he lost eleven members of his family. Survivors were also plagued by discrimination: when Satoshi was a student, a worried flatmate asked him if he was infectious. In his fifties, he was diagnosed with the first of what would
                be six cancers. Illness is a constant worry for survivors. And with the rising nuclear threat, Satoshi
                says “they are not old
                stories.
                It
                is continuing today”. There were over 370,000 in 1980. Now, there are only just over
                100,000. “It is said that
                in
                ten
                years, there will be no survivors left”, says Satoshi.</p>

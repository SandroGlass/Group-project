        <p>A 2024 study found that almost three quarters of Ukrainians want them back.

            a

            believes Ukraine could have protected itself better.</p>

        <p>"It was too binary—either give up nukes or not, without considering options in between," Budjeryn argues.

        <p>"I'm pretty sure the world would have paid closer attention to Ukraine's borders for fear of its nuclear

            <p style="width: auto; margin-right: 20px; line-height: 1.4; text-indent:20px;"> When Ukraine signed
                the
                1994 Budapest Memorandum, it surrendered approximately 1,900 strategic nuclear warheads for security
                assurances from Russia, the US, and UK.
                These promises crumbled when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and later launched a full-scale invasion,
                leaving Ukraine defenseless against an aggressor that had pledged to respect its borders. Recent
                studies
                show nearly three-quarters of Ukrainians now regret giving up their nuclear deterrent. In March
                2022,
                President Zelensky bitterly noted that allies had provided only "50 tons of diesel fuel... probably
                so
                that we can burn the Budapest Memorandum."</p>

                due
                to
                radiation, and he had lost eleven of them, and one missing. When he was a university student, he
                faced a
                discrimination against him when a flatmate asked, “Are you sure the atomic bomb disease is not
                infectious?”.
                And
                since in his fifties, he suffered from six cancers. He, along with many survivors today, are afraid
                of
                cancers
                and illnesses that might strike. And with the rising nuclear threat, Satoshi says “they are not old
                stories.
                It
                is continuing today”.</p>

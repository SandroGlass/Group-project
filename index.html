        <p>Ukraine inherited the world’s third-biggest nuclear arsenal in 1991 before giving them up as part of
            Budapest

        <p>A 2024 study found that almost three quarters of Ukrainians want them back.

            of
            a
            book about Ukraine’s nuclear disarmament, doesn’t believe the arsenal would have prevented Russia’s
            invasion
            but
            believes Ukraine could have protected itself better.</p>

        <p>"It was too binary—either give up nukes or not, without considering options in between," Budjeryn argues.
        </p>

        <p>"I'm pretty sure the world would have paid closer attention to Ukraine's borders for fear of its nuclear
            program," she concludes.</p>

        <p>“We have to keep telling and recording our stories to let people know what happened” insists Satoshi
            Tanaka,
            a
            member of the Nobel Peace Prize winning survivor group Nihon Hidankyo.</p>

        <p>The 81-year-old survivor of Hiroshima is concerned that amid the rise of nuclear risk, people who can
            tell
            stories of what happens when the weapons are used are dwindling.</p>
        <p>There used to be at least over 370,000 in 1980. Now, there are only just over 100,000. “It is said that
            in
            ten
            years, there will be no survivors left”, says Satoshi.</p>

        <p> Satoshi Tanaka entered the
        destroyed city of
        Hiroshima the day after the bombing at 1 year-old. His family and relatives suffered injury and illness due
        to
        radiation, and he had lost eleven of them, and one missing. When he was a university student, he faced a
        discrimination against him when a flatmate asked, “Are you sure the atomic bomb disease is not infectious?”.
        And
        since in his fifties, he suffered from six cancers. He, along with many survivors today, are afraid of
        cancers
        and illnesses that might strike. And with the rising nuclear threat, Satoshi says “they are not old stories.
        It
        is continuing today”.</p>

                            States, United Kingdom, and Russia. By 1996, all nuclear warheads had been transferred to
                            Russia for dismantlement, and Ukraine officially became a non-nuclear state.</p>

                <h2>The Legacy of Denuclearization</h2>
                <p>Ukraine's decision to denuclearize made it the first country in history to voluntarily give up a
                    nuclear arsenal. The security assurances provided in the Budapest Memorandum later became a matter
                    of significant controversy following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the full-scale
                    invasion in 2022.</p>
                <p>Is it safer to hold nuclear weapons? Or is it better to get rid of them completely from this world?

                            arsenal in the world. This map shows all nuclear and military facilities in Ukraine as of

                        <p>Ukraine operated several nuclear power plants, including the infamous Chornobyl plant which
                            experienced a catastrophic accident in 1986. These plants provided a significant portion of

                        <p>In December 1994, Ukraine signed the Budapest Memorandum, agreeing to give up all nuclear
                            weapons inherited from the Soviet Union in exchange for security assurances from the United
                            States, United Kingdom, and Russia. By 1996, all nuclear warheads had been transferred to
                            Russia for dismantlement, and Ukraine officially became a non-nuclear state.</p>

                <h2>The Legacy of Denuclearization</h2>
                <p>Ukraine's decision to denuclearize made it the first country in history to voluntarily give up a
                    nuclear arsenal. The security assurances provided in the Budapest Memorandum later became a matter
                    of significant controversy following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the full-scale
                    invasion in 2022.</p>
                <p>Is it safer to hold nuclear weapons? Or is it better to get rid of them completely from this world?
